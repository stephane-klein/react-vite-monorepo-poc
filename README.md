Repository content:

- App centric monorepo project:
  > "app centric" repositories which are used mainly for developing applications and products. This is a common setup in companies.
  > Such repos are characterized in having an apps and packages or libs folder, where the apps folder contains the buildable and
  > deployable applications, while the packages or libs folder contains libraries that are specific to one or multiple applications
  > that are being developed within the monorepo. You can still also publish some of these libs to a public registry.
